# Incident Troubleshooting Scenario: Cross-Region MySQL Replication Failure

## Executive Summary

On August 3rd, 2025, at 14:32 UTC, our multi-region microservices platform experienced a critical MySQL replication failure between the primary database in Frankfurt and the secondary replica in Jeddah. The incident resulted in 43 minutes of degraded service, affecting 15% of user requests and causing temporary data inconsistency between regions. This document details the complete incident lifecycle, from detection through resolution, and outlines the lessons learned and improvements implemented.

## Incident Timeline

### Detection Phase (14:32 - 14:35 UTC)
The incident was first detected through our comprehensive monitoring stack:

**Initial Alert**: Prometheus alert `MySQLReplicationLag` triggered at 14:32 UTC, indicating replication lag had exceeded the 30-second threshold.

**Escalation**: The alert was immediately routed to the on-call SRE team via PagerDuty, with automatic escalation to the database team after 5 minutes.

**Dashboard Confirmation**: The SRE team confirmed the issue through our Grafana dashboard, which showed:
- Replication lag: 960 seconds (16 minutes)
- Primary database: Healthy, processing writes normally
- Secondary database: Stale reads, affecting 15% of user requests

### Triage Phase (14:35 - 14:45 UTC)
The incident commander initiated the incident response process:

**Immediate Assessment**:
- **Primary Impact**: 15% of users experiencing stale data reads
- **Secondary Impact**: Risk of data loss if primary database failed
- **Business Impact**: Minimal revenue impact (orders processed after recovery)

**Root Cause Investigation**:
The database team identified the root cause through log analysis:
- Network packet loss during a planned maintenance window
- GTID (Global Transaction ID) corruption in the replication stream
- Replication thread failure due to inconsistent transaction state

**Communication**:
- 14:37 UTC: Initial incident notification sent to stakeholders
- 14:40 UTC: Status page updated with incident details
- 14:42 UTC: Customer support team briefed on potential user impact

### Mitigation Phase (14:45 - 15:15 UTC)
The database team executed the following recovery procedures:

**Immediate Actions (14:45 - 14:55 UTC)**:
1. **Stop Replication**: Safely stopped the replication process to prevent further corruption
2. **Backup Verification**: Confirmed recent backups were consistent and available
3. **Network Analysis**: Identified and resolved the underlying network issue

**Recovery Actions (14:55 - 15:10 UTC)**:
1. **GTID Reset**: Manually reset the GTID state to ensure consistency
2. **Replication Restart**: Restarted replication with a fresh snapshot
3. **Consistency Check**: Verified data consistency between primary and secondary

**Verification (15:10 - 15:15 UTC)**:
1. **Health Checks**: Confirmed all database health checks passing
2. **Application Testing**: Verified application connectivity and data consistency
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitored response times and error rates

### Resolution Phase (15:15 - 15:15 UTC)
**Incident Resolution**: At 15:15 UTC, all systems were confirmed operational:
- Replication lag: 0 seconds
- Error rate: 0%
- Response times: Normal baseline

**Post-Incident Actions**:
- 15:20 UTC: Incident resolved notification sent
- 15:25 UTC: Status page updated to "Resolved"
- 15:30 UTC: Post-incident review scheduled

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The incident was caused by a combination of factors:

1. **Primary Cause**: Network instability during a planned maintenance window led to packet loss between regions
2. **Secondary Cause**: The replication thread failed to handle the GTID corruption gracefully
3. **Contributing Factor**: Insufficient monitoring of network stability between regions

### Impact Assessment
**Technical Impact**:
- Replication lag: 960 seconds (16 minutes)
- Affected users: 15% of total user base
- Data consistency: Temporary inconsistency between regions
- No data loss occurred

**Business Impact**:
- Orders affected: 127 orders experienced delayed processing
- Revenue impact: Minimal (orders processed after recovery)
- Customer experience: 15-minute delay in order confirmations

### Recovery Procedures Executed
1. **Emergency Response**:
   ```bash
   # Stop replication safely
   mysql -h secondary-db -u admin -p -e "STOP SLAVE"
   
   # Check GTID state
   mysql -h secondary-db -u admin -p -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G"
   ```

2. **GTID Recovery**:
   ```bash
   # Reset GTID state
   mysql -h secondary-db -u admin -p -e "RESET SLAVE ALL"
   
   # Restart replication with fresh snapshot
   mysql -h secondary-db -u admin -p -e "CHANGE MASTER TO ..."
   ```

3. **Verification**:
   ```bash
   # Check replication status
   mysql -h secondary-db -u admin -p -e "SHOW SLAVE STATUS\G"
   
   # Verify consistency
   mysql -h primary-db -u admin -p -e "CHECKSUM TABLE orders"
   ```

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Quick Detection**: Prometheus alerts triggered within 2 minutes of the issue
2. **Effective Communication**: Clear incident updates to stakeholders
3. **Team Coordination**: SRE and database teams worked effectively together
4. **No Data Loss**: All data was preserved during the incident

### What Went Wrong
1. **Network Monitoring**: Insufficient monitoring of inter-region network stability
2. **GTID Handling**: Replication thread failed to handle GTID corruption gracefully
3. **Alert Escalation**: Delayed escalation to database team
4. **Documentation**: Runbook procedures needed updating

### What to Improve
1. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Implement network stability monitoring between regions
2. **Automated Recovery**: Develop automated GTID recovery procedures
3. **Alert Optimization**: Improve alert routing and escalation procedures
4. **Runbook Updates**: Update procedures based on lessons learned

## Action Items and Follow-up

### Immediate Actions (Completed)

## Conclusion

This incident demonstrated the effectiveness of our monitoring and incident response procedures while highlighting areas for improvement. The quick detection and coordinated response minimized business impact, and the lessons learned will strengthen our platform's resilience. The implementation of the identified improvements will further enhance our ability to handle similar incidents in the future.

The incident also validated our multi-region architecture's effectiveness, as the primary region continued operating normally while we resolved the replication issue. This reinforces the value of our investment in high availability and disaster recovery capabilities.
